# SpaceY - Data Science Project

A Data science project that will predict the landing outcome of the SpaceX' Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. As a competitor company called SPACEY, we want to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

In this project, we will perform various operations in order to achieve the requirement. Below are the overview of the project:
- Data collection
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
- Interactive Visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
- Predictive analysis using classification models:
  - GridSearchCV - To find the best parameters
  - KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression 


### Objectives:
- To determine if the first stage will land
- To determine the cost of the launch
- To use this information as an alternate company to bid against SpaceX
